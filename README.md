## Next.js 15 and React 19 Monorepo Boilerplate

Welcome to the Next.js Monorepo Boilerplate(NextJs 15, ReactJs 19)! This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for managing complex web applications with multiple applications and shared packages in a single, efficient monorepo. It contains a basic auth based on Next-auth.

## ðŸš€ What's inside?

- `app`: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `@repo/ui`:  a stub React component library with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com//)

Additional tools already setup:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting


## ðŸ¤– Installation

To get started, clone the repository. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) and [Docker](https://docker.com/) installed.

## ðŸ¤¸ Quick Start

This project is Docker-ready, supporting both development and production environments. But you don't have to use it, if you prefer using local tools like Node.js, pnpm, etc., feel free to do so! Just check `package.json` for available scripts.

### Development

Copy [.env.example] and rename it to `.env` then add your environment variables.


1. Build the image.

```bash
   pnpm install
   docker-compose --profile dev build
```

2. Run the container and initialize prisma

```bash
   docker-compose --profile dev up -d && pnpm run prisma:init:development
```

You can then access your applications on `http://localhost:3000`.

To build production image, just set `prod` in  `--profile` flag and in `.env` change the value of `NODE_ENV` to `production`


### Makefile

Usage

You can simply run make <command> in your terminal. For example, to build your project, you would run:

`make dev-build`

`make dev-init`

For more information on each command, you can refer to the comments in the Makefile

## ðŸ”‹ Release Process and Changelog

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for version numbers. All notable changes to this project are automatically documented in the release notes.

### Automated Changelog

Our project uses release-drafter to automatically generate changelogs based on PR titles and labels. When creating a pull request, please ensure that the title clearly describes the change and that appropriate labels are applied. This will help in generating accurate and informative release notes.

### Creating a Release

1. Ensure all changes for the release are merged into the main branch.

2. Create a new tag with the version number:
   ```
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Create a new GitHub release
   - Generate release notes based on merged pull requests
   - Build and push Docker images

4. Review the auto-generated release notes on GitHub and make any necessary edits.

5. Publish the release on GitHub.

This automated process ensures that our changelog is always up-to-date and reflects all the changes made in each release. It reduces manual work and helps maintain consistency in our release notes.

Remember to write clear and descriptive PR titles and use appropriate labels, as these will directly contribute to the quality of our release notes.
